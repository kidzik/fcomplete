# `fcomplete` - Longitudinal data analysis using matrix completion

Suppose you observe N subjects, each at some different timepoints and you want to estimate a trajectory of how measurements evolve for individual subjects. For example, suppose you observe BMI of N children at different ages, as presented below

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/kidzinski/kidzinski/fcomplete/grouped.png" width="350" /></div>

In this package we follow the methodology from [Kidzi≈Ñski, Hastie (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08771) to fit the trajectories using matrix completion. We discretize the time grid some continous basis and find a low rank decompozition

The interface of the package is based on the mixed-effect models in \verb|R|. In particular, if your temporal observations `Y` are in the long format with columns `id`, `age` and `bmi`, while additional covariates `X`, constant over time are given as a data frame with columns `id` and, say, `gender`, you can fit the model by writing

```R
model = fregression(bmi ~ age + gender | id, data = Y, covariates = X)
print(model)
```

## Installation

```R
library("devtools")
install_git("https://github.com/kidzik/fcomplete/")
```

See vignettes (https://github.com/kidzik/fcomplete/tree/master/vignettes) for example use.

2. [Regularization](https://github.com/kidzik/fcomplete/tree/master/vignettes/Regularization.ipynb)
3. [Regression](https://github.com/kidzik/fcomplete/tree/master/vignettes/Regression.ipynb)

## For developers

For now it's designed for editing in R Studio.

### Installation
1. Open RStudio
2. Open `fcomplete.Rproj` project
3. Install packages: `devtools`, `ggplot2`, `mclust`
4. Open the `examples/example.R` script
5. Run the script. The script will:
    * Install our `fcomplete` package
    * Load simulated data
    * Run the method
    * Plot estimates, components and projections,
    * Run basic clustering on projections

### Compiling manual

You can generate the manual by running
```bash
R CMD Rd2pdf fcomplete
```
from the parent directory to `fcomplete`.

### Running Tests

Examples are in tests for now. The main two examples (from the paper) are:
* `simulation.full.R` -- the simulation study from the paper
* `data.full.R` -- the data study from the paper
