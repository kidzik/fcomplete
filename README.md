# Longitudinal data analysis using matrix completion

Suppose we observe N subjects, each subject at multiple timepoints and we want to estimate a trajectory of progression of measurements in individual subjects. For example, suppose you observe BMI of N children at different ages, as presented below

Here, the connected dots come from individual subjects and the black thick line corresponds to the population mean.

In this package we follow the methodology from [Kidzi≈Ñski, Hastie (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08771) to fit trajectories using matrix completion. To this end, we discretize the time grid some continous basis and find a low-rank decomposition of the dense matrix.

In the classical matrix completion, we look for matrices `W` and `A` that fit the observed points in `Y` (green points in the image above). In our method, in order to impose smoothness, we additionaly assume the basis `B` and again we look for the reprezentation minimizing the errror. 

The interface of the package is based on the mixed-effect models in `R`. In particular, if we are given temporal observations `Y` in the long format with columns `id`, `age` and `bmi`, while additional covariates `X`, constant over time are given as a data frame with columns `id` and, say, `gender`, we can fit the model by writing

```R
model = fregression(bmi ~ age + gender | id, data = Y, covariates = X)
print(model)
```

## Installation

```R
library("devtools")
install_git("https://github.com/kidzik/fcomplete/")
```

See vignettes (https://github.com/kidzik/fcomplete/tree/master/vignettes) for example use.

2. [Regularization](https://github.com/kidzik/fcomplete/tree/master/vignettes/Regularization.ipynb)
3. [Regression](https://github.com/kidzik/fcomplete/tree/master/vignettes/Regression.ipynb)

## For developers

For now it's designed for editing in R Studio.

### Installation
1. Open RStudio
2. Open `fcomplete.Rproj` project
3. Install packages: `devtools`, `ggplot2`, `mclust`
4. Open the `examples/example.R` script
5. Run the script. The script will:
    * Install our `fcomplete` package
    * Load simulated data
    * Run the method
    * Plot estimates, components and projections,
    * Run basic clustering on projections

### Compiling manual

You can generate the manual by running
```bash
R CMD Rd2pdf fcomplete
```
from the parent directory to `fcomplete`.

### Running Tests

Examples are in tests for now. The main two examples (from the paper) are:
* `simulation.full.R` -- the simulation study from the paper
* `data.full.R` -- the data study from the paper
